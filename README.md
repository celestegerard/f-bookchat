#### a chat app to sync up readers on the same chapter of a classic novel ####

Have you ever been left on a literary cliffhanger with no one you talk you down from it? With Bookchat, readers can sign in and chat with other readers in the same part of the book, in real time. Each chat room is designed for a specific location of the classic, made available through the Google Book API.
